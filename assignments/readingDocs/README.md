#  Reading the Documentation
Assignments in reading the coding documentation for HTML and CSS

## A summary
A key process in working with webdevelopment, programming.. actually anything to do with any language or math.. is reading the documentation. 
We all know we need to read a book, a guide or at least see an instructional video when we are learning any new subject. However in webdevelopment it's unrealistic to expect to learn everything by heart or even remember it. And why should we? 

Webdevelopment is constantly changing. New programming languages ermege or you just work a lot with a specific project for at time and you might forget some of the stuff relevant to other projects or languages. This is OK this happens whether you a new or a pro in the business. 

Lucky for us we have documentation. These are like dictionaries, encyclpedias and articles on everything you'll work with. It has also become convention that you write your own documentation for the apps, libraries, APIs etc that you yourself develop. Basically be a good sport and give your fellow programmer a chance to understand and learn and further develop from the code you provide. 

Often you will work in teams or you will work on some code someone else wrote a long time ago. We all agree it's a bitch to deal with badly written undocumented code - so don't be that person. 

### A most important tool
As a webdeveloper you WILL consult documentation on a daily basis. It's more important to be able to look something up and understand and implement it than it is to just copy and swear when it doesn't work as intended. Yes you will copy a lot as well, but know WHAT you copy and how it works is essential. 

So when we tell you to look into the documentation or ask you what the documentation says it's not because we don't want to tell you our selves it's because HOW to look up the documentation is a skill and a process that needs to be automatic for you. However, we do always stand by for any question even tips on what to google if you can't find it yourself. We WILL clarify and we will help and teach you how you can do this your self in the end. 

## The assignment
So this is the assignment - These files constitutes a simple webpage - not with a lot functionality but it's a basic static onepage design. It works.
In the code in the documents index.html and style.css is a lot of comments - these comments constitutes of a question marked with `Q: ` and an answer marked with `A: `.

Your job is to answer the question and write it after the `A: `. 

The questions relate to the code and the point is that you don't know the answer before finding it. You will have to look it up in the documentation. 

There are several webpages that hold the documentation but mostly we will refer to [MDN (mozillas documentation on frontend development)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). 
Wether you look it up in MDN drectly, or you google for example `CSS fixed position MDN` or just `CSS fixed position` is up to you. Sometimes the documentation doesn't quite explain it enough but then you can google, youtube, ask your aunt. The exercise is in HOW to find answers.
