# Introducing webdevelopment on GF1
- and yes the text is english as the main language you'll find in tutroials and documentations will be english. However - the video language and language spoken when presenting at the whiteboard is danish. 

### The goal
The goal is for all students to have finished the following assignments within a week and a half:
* Installation and configuration
* debugSyntax
* readingDocs
* followTutorial

By then they should be familiar with the tools used in webdevelopment, have made and deployed their first website. 

If the students finish these assignments before the week is up and seek a little further challenge they can complete these following bonus assignments:
* newTheme
* translateDesign

When these are finished they should be able to independently use the tools learned to create a static HTML and CSS website.

### The inventory
This repository contains assignments used to introduce GF1 students to webdevelopment. The assignments proceeds installation and configuration of the following programmes/accounts:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* Visual Studio Code - extensions
    * Livserver
    * prettier

## Subjects and instructions to go over before the assignments

Set up git in VS Code by following these instructions: 
* Open terminal > new terminal
* copy/write : `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` press enter
* copy/write : `git config --global user.email yourmail@email.com` press enter

Subjects for Quick guide in using github and VS Code:
* create a local project in VS Code
* create a index.html and style.css in project (go over the basic of syntax and how to link a stylesheet)
* stage and commit local project
* add repository on github through `new` button on github
* manually adding files to github repository through `add file` button on github
* add a remote repository to a local repository in VS Code (through the GUI: Source control icon > ... > remote > add remote)
* push local files to remote repository in VS Code (through the GUI: Source control icon > ... > push and pull > push ) (if they aren't signed in then just press the button `sign in in browser`)
* clone repository in VS Code with HTTPS link from github (in this assignment they clone the assignment folder from this repo

## The assignments
This course focus more on the "how to learn" than the "how to do" part of the education. Every assignment is linked to a specific process or procedure that a webdeveloper use everyday both as a students and after graduation. 

The assignments should be completed in following order: 
* Installation and configuring - 3 lessons
* debugSyntax - 1 lessons
* readingDocs - 1-2 lessons 
* followTutorial - 8-11 lessons 
* newTheme - 2-3 lessons
* translateDesign - 10 lessons (maybe)

### debugSyntax
Inroduces syntax for HTML and CSS through debugging. Also teaches how to use the syntax highlighter in VS Code and focus on syntax errors being the culprit most of the times even after 20 years of coding. 

### readingDocs
Introduces how to use documentation and how to look through code, ask and answer questions about it. This skill is used throughout the following assignments. 

### followTutorial
Introduces how to start, code, commit and deploy a project from start to finish. They learn how to follow a video tutorial and the result will be their own digital business card. This lesson vary a lot in speed for the students but most have finished within a day and a half. 

This assignments also contains 2 bonus videos #7 and #8. These videos shows how to add a portfolio to the website and introduces navigation. 

### newTheme
Introduces variables in CSS more hands on and how to follow a textual guide/instruction with the expectation that they can search the documentation  for knowledge at this point. It also introduces the idea of themes in webdesign/development and how to break up stylesheets.


### translateDesign
Introduces wireframes and how to use them to translate a resume design in a PDF file into HTML. This assignment requires that they use what they have learned in the other assignments with minimal guidance. The result will be the HTML skeleton of the design. An exmple of how this should look is included in the assignment. 

This assignment also contains a bonus assignment that is creating the styling for the resume so it looks like the original design. Though they are free to use whatever, content, colors and typography that they like. It would be beneficial if the students have finished the [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#da) game before starting this bonus assignment.

### Frequently Asked Questions
So far the most common questions and need for help has been following:
* Simple syntax/spelling errors - those are expected help them to read the hints from syntax highlighter
* Missed the step of connecting github repo and local repo in the video tutorial - help them to add and configure remote through the source control GUI
