# Follow a tutorial
Assignment in following a video tutorial for a coding project. 

## Social Media is golden
A way to learn about how to code is by following "how to" videos or just watch videos where people talk about the theory behind the code.
Another tool that we also use to teach is code-alongs. Where we code together live while explaining what we are doing. We are general big fans of learning by doing. 

Youtube is a great resource for this - but so are github, codepen, Tik Tok, instagram and twitter for that matter. Take a search around your preffered social media and see if you find anyone worth following. People are more than willing to provide new, tips, tricks, tutorials and shit ton of humor and a comunity for developers, even those still learning. 

Especially twitter is actively used in the business so if you don't already have an account then sign up if only to follow what is happening within development tech. 

This is also why we are making a digital business card. This is what you can link to in your Social media profiles this is the start of your portfolio. This is what you show companies and recruiters and what you will refer to when networking.

**IMPORTANT INFO:**
* Video **#14** shows you how to deploy the webpage so anyone can acces your page with the link. You can follow this instruction after video **#8**, **#11** or **#13** - depending on how far you get. 
* The video also contains a lot of tips, tricks and usefull knowledge about how and why, so take a listen and read the descriptions for each video as the might provide important information and usefull links. 
* IF the video is too slow or fast - remember that you can turn up/down the pace of the video on the player. 
* The videos also shows the process of the development including any mistakes - so sometimes it makes sense to listen or watch the video before you start to follow along with the code. It's a good exercise in reading and understanding the assignment before executing the solution. ;)
