# Introducing webdevelopment on GF1
*and yes the text is english as the main language you'll find in tutroials and documentations will be english. However - the video language and language spoken when presenting at the whiteboard is danish.* 

### The goal
The goal is for all students to have finished the following assignments within a week and a half:
* Installation and configuration
* debugSyntax
* readingDocs
* followTutorial (video 1 - 8 (+14))

By then they should be familiar with the tools used in webdevelopment, have made and deployed their first website. 

If the students finish these assignments before the week is up and seek a little further challenge they can complete these following bonus assignments:
* followTutorial (video 9 - 14)
* newTheme
* translateDesign

When these are finished they should be able to independently use the tools learned to create a static HTML and CSS website.

### The inventory
This repository contains assignments used to introduce GF1 students to webdevelopment. The assignments proceeds installation and configuration of the following programmes/accounts:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code - extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
    * [Liveserver](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
    * [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Subjects and instructions to go over before the assignments
These should be done in plenum with the projector and supported by a todo list on the chosen LMS (moodle/teams).

Set up git in VS Code by following these instructions: 
* Open terminal > new terminal
* copy/write : `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` press enter
* copy/write : `git config --global user.email yourmail@email.com` press enter

Subjects for Quick guide in using github and VS Code:
* create a local project in VS Code
* create a index.html and style.css in project (go over the basic of syntax and how to link a stylesheet)
* stage and commit local project
* add repository on github through `new` button on github
* manually adding files to github repository through `add file` button on github
* add a remote repository to a local repository in VS Code (through the GUI: Source control icon > ... > remote > add remote)
* push local files to remote repository in VS Code (through the GUI: Source control icon > ... > push and pull > push ) (if they aren't signed in then just press the button `sign in in browser`)
* clone repository in VS Code with HTTPS link from github (in this assignment they clone the assignment folder from this repo

## The assignments
This course focus more on the "how to learn" than the "how to do" part of the education. Every assignment is linked to a specific process or procedure that a webdeveloper use everyday both as a students and after graduation. 

The assignments should be completed in following order: 
* Installation and configuring (see above)- 3 lessons
* debugSyntax - 1 lessons
* readingDocs - 1-2 lessons 
* followTutorial - 8-11+ lessons 
* newTheme - 1 lesson
* translateDesign - 10 lessons

### debugSyntax
Inroduces syntax for HTML and CSS through debugging. Also teaches how to use the syntax highlighter in VS Code and focus on syntax errors being the culprit most of the times even after 20 years of coding. 

### readingDocs
Introduces how to use documentation and how to look through code, ask and answer questions about it. This skill is used throughout the following assignments. 

### followTutorial
Introduces how to start, code, commit and deploy a project from start to finish. They learn how to follow a video tutorial and the result will be their own website constaining an online businesscard, resume and portfolio. This lesson vary a lot in speed for the students but most have finished the businesscard within 2 days. They will also gain insight to the process of how to work thorugh comments, tips and etc. in the videos.

This assignment should as a minimum have the requirement to finish video #1 - #8 + video #14 (the deployment video). While video #9 to #13 is more a "nice to have". The Portfolio being requested by the students and the Resume giving the prerequisit to solve the translateDesign assignment. 

In this assignment the students should be encouraged to be creative and play around with the styling after finishing the tutorial. The newTheme assignment can help in this. Another natural follow up is [flexbox froggy](), [Grid Garden]() as well as some ressources for current design trends. Some articles I've found useful for now is following: 

* []()
* []()

**TIP: The long hours staring at a screen and me talking might be sleep inducing - remember to break up the workflow with follow ups, games and literally just going outside.**

### newTheme
Introduces variables in CSS more hands on and how to follow a textual guide/instruction with the expectation that they can search the documentation  for knowledge at this point. It also introduces the idea of themes in webdesign/development and how to break up stylesheets.


### translateDesign
Introduces wireframes and how to use them to translate a resume design in a PDF file into HTML. This assignment requires that they use what they have learned in the other assignments with minimal guidance. The result will be a replica of the design. 

This assignment brings together the skills taught as well as teaching how to recreate a design to a point and in this how to read and follow a strict assignment. 

### Frequently Asked Questions
So far the most common questions and need for help has been following:
* Simple syntax/spelling errors - those are expected help them to read the hints from syntax highlighter
* Missed the step of connecting github repo and local repo in the video tutorial - help them to add and configure remote through the source control GUI
