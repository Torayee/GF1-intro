# Follow a tutorial
Assignment in following a video tutorial for a coding project. 

## Social Media is golden
A way to learn about how to code is by following "how to" videos or just watch videos where people talk about the theory behind the code.
Another tool that we also use to teach is code-alongs. Where we code together live while explaining what we are doing. We are general big fans of learning by doing. 

Youtube is a great resource for this - but so are github, codepen, Tik Tok, instagram and twitter for that matter. Take a search around your preffered social media and see if you find anyone worth following. People are more than willing to provide new, tips, tricks, tutorials and shit ton of humor and a comunity for developers, even those still learning. 

Especially twitter is actively used in the business so if you don't already have an account then sign up if only to follow what is happening within development tech. 

This is also why we are making a digital business card. This is what you can link to in your Social media profiles this is the start of your portfolio. This is what you show companies and recruiters and what you will refer to when networking. 


## The assignment
This assignment is following a tutorial from youtube on how to make a digital business card in HTML and CSS - the tutorial starts from scratch. We will watch the videos together and try and code along or we will pause if there is any questions. After the video we will use some time to catch up and code and debug etc. before continuing with the next video and step in the tutorial. 

The video uses several external tools/websites during the process. These are listed in the video descriptions - and here.
